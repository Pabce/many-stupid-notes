# Notation
Some common notation we use in [[Neutrino-nucleus/The nuclear many-body problem ðŸ¤¯\|The nuclear many-body problem ðŸ¤¯]] and this section in general.

- We will use the shorthand _p_ and _h_ for particle and hole states, and also their combinations (i.e. _pp_, _ph_, _hp_, _hh_).
- For single particle subindices, we will use $i, j$ for _hole_ states, $m, n$ for _particle_ states and $k, l, p, q$ for generic states. Note that $p$ will be used also exclusively when referring to paired particles in [[Neutrino-nucleus/HF-Bogoliubov\|HF-Bogoliubov]], which is a bit confusing.
- We will often use the "antisymmetrized potential", defined like so:
    $$
    \bar{v}_{ab,cd} = v_{ab,cd} - v_{ab,dc}
    $$
    where
    $$
    v_{ab,cd}=\braket{ab|v(1,2,3,4)|cd}   
    $$
    and $v$ is the most general from of a two-particle potential.

## Particle-Hole picture
For many-body systems, it is useful to use basis states that are labeled as deviations/excitations from some reference many body Slater determinant (vs states with N creation operators acting on the vacuum )
