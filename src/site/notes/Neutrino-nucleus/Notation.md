# Notation
Some common notation we use in [[Neutrino-nucleus/The nuclear many-body problem ðŸ¤¯\|The nuclear many-body problem ðŸ¤¯]] and this section in general.

- We will use the shorthand _p_ and _h_ for particle and hole states, and also their combinations (i.e. _pp_, _ph_, _hp_, _hh_).
- For single particle subindices, we will use $i, j$ for _hole_ states, $m, n$ for _particle_ states and $k, l, p, k$ for generic states. Note that $p$ will be used also exclusively when referring to paired particles in [[Neutrino-nucleus/HF-Bogoliubov\|HF-Bogoliubov]], which is a bit confusing.
