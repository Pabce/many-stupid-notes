# RPA and beyond
Hartree-Fock and all it's extensions (up to [[Neutrino-nucleus/HF-Bogoliubov\|HF-Bogoliubov]] in the most general quasiparticle formalism) are static, independent particle models. By a proper definition of (quasi)particles we can explain the basic properties of the ground states of many nuclei, and also some of their excited states. 
But there are many excited states that cannot be reproduced by the above. These missing excitations will be explained by collective, many-body (coherent) correlations within the nucleus:
1. Their EM transition probabilities are one or two orders of magnitude larger than the single-particle transitions.
2. They show up in the spectra of different nuclei with great regularity. A good example is the giant dipole resonance.

This is treated in the context of the _residual interaction_, i.e., the difference between the full, many-body potential and the HF mean field. It will give an explanation of high-lying (resonances) and low lying (bound states) collective vibrations. 
These collective states arise mostly from the long-range part of the nuclear force, i.e., the _particle-hole_ pairing force.

**Note: The Tamm-Dancoff method** is a first approach to tackling the interaction between ph-pairs. It is superseded by RPA in several ways, mainly in that TD does not take into account these correlations for the ground state, which remains unmodified.

This is the most complete way of treating harmonic perturbations, and can be used as a plug-in to [[Neutrino-nucleus/HF-Bogoliubov\|HFB]]
